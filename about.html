                Welcome to my nail page! I'm Chantida, a passionate nail technician based in South Hill, Washington. Growing up, I always loved art, and doing nails became my favorite way to express creativity. I started at 17, doing acrylic nails for friends with supermarket nail packs. In 2023, I apprenticed in Cambodia, which deepened my love for nails, and by 2024, I fully committed to being a nail technician.ðŸ’…ðŸ’•

                As your nail technician, I aim to provide a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Whether you want a classic manicure or trendy nail art, I stay updated with the latest trends and techniques to ensure top-quality service. Your satisfaction is my priority, and I take pride in my attention to detail. While I strive for perfection, I do need time, so please be patient with me! Currently, I offer Gel-X and am working on expanding into acrylics again.
				Thank you for choosing me! I can't wait to meet you and create beautiful nails together
